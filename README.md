[N.Y.’s Vaccine Websites Weren’t Working. He Built a New One for $50.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html)

I thought that it was interesting that a website that took less than two weeks to complete became an essential part in helping to schedule coronavirus vaccine appointments in New York City. TurboVax's twitter account currently has almost 60,000 followers. Huge Ma built this in order to ease the search for an appointment. I believe that similar websites/apps will be needed for other cities. I also found it interesting that the article pointed out the issues with scheduling Covid-19 vaccines. The current scheduling systems are complicated. They are especially difficult for elderly who lack technology skills. Since the elderly are part of the ones who need the vaccines the most, developers should find a way to make it more user friendly.
