[N.Y.’s Vaccine Websites Weren’t Working. He Built a New One for $50.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html)

I thought that it was interesting that a website that took less than two weeks to complete became an essential part in helping to schedule coronavirus vaccine appointments in New York City. TurboVax's twitter account currently has almost 60,000 followers. Huge Ma built this in order to ease the search for an appointment. I believe that similar websites/apps will be needed for other cities. I also found it interesting that the article pointed out the issues with scheduling Covid-19 vaccines. The current scheduling systems are complicated. They are especially difficult for elderly who lack technology skills. Since the elderly are part of the ones who need the vaccines the most, developers should find a way to make it more user friendly.

Rather than find this article inspiring, I find that it further reveals how painfully inadequate governmental and public sector technology is - a situation that could lead to more preventable deaths in the face of a global pandemic. A lot of college graduates who major in computer science choose to pursue a career in the private sector due to monetary benefits and even the reputation that comes along with a career at a 'top' company. But this trend only diverts talent that is desperately needed in sectors such as the government - and in the end can only come to bite as back as we and our families need to not only sign up for these vaccines but also future health crises that may come. How can a government be expected to properly serve its people if it cannot overcome its own technological hurdles?
